"# BIGDATA-ANALYTICS-USING-PYTHON" 



This is the repository I have  created while I have started learning Big data analytics using python,
I tried to cover everything in this, starting from scratch like basics of python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib and taking all the way to advanced concepts like, Unsupervised learning, Link Analysis and simple example of neural network for image classfication.


I have also worked on a project "Portfolio creation and Behavioral finance" to sum up everything I have learnt, you can check that out too!!!
